This is a maven java project.

maven is available here - https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

You may need to run - mvn install -  in the commandline to insure that required dependencies are downloaded.  

There are two unit test classes:
ProductDetailsTest
WebScraperServiceTest

The command - mvn test - will run all tests. 

The main class WebScraper can be run from the commandline with - java WebScraper.java
(javac WebScraper.java to compile)

Alternatively import the project into an IDE and run WebScraper as a Java Application and the test as JUnit tests.
